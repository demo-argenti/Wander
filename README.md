# About

Even though Homeworkstuck was my first video game, this is the one I always consider to be my first actual game. I mde this in about a week for the 2021 Blackthornprod Game Jam, and while I missed the deadline to submit it, I am super pleased with what I made. The theme for the jam was "Less is More," and so I decided to create a minimalist game focusing on creating an evocaative mood with minimalist game mechanics. My experiment was to try to make a compelling game with as little stuff in it as I could get away with. To that end, I focused on things like animation, sound design, music, and writing to create the feeling of solitude, loneliness, and quiet contemplation. I think I succeeded in that goal.
